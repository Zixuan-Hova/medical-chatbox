# Understanding Arrhythmia (Irregular Heartbeat)

**Arrhythmia** is a medical term for an **irregular heartbeat**. It means that your heart may beat too fast, too slow, or with an uneven rhythm.

## Common Types of Arrhythmia

- **Bradycardia** – heart beats too slowly.
- **Tachycardia** – heart beats too quickly.
- **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)** – heart beats irregularly or skips beats.

## Why It Matters in Surgery

Arrhythmia is important to note before surgery because it can affect how your body handles anesthesia and stress. That’s why it appears on preoperative consent forms — so doctors can plan extra precautions if needed.

## What You Should Do

If your consent form mentions arrhythmia, it’s a good idea to:
- Let your surgeon and anesthesiologist know about any heart symptoms
- Ask questions about how it might affect your procedure
- Bring a list of medications you're taking
