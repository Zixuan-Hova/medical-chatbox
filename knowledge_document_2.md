# Understanding ASA II Classification

**ASA II** is a term from the **ASA Physical Status Classification System**, which helps doctors assess a patient's overall health before surgery.

## What Does ASA II Mean?

ASA II means the patient has a **mild, well-controlled medical condition** that **does not limit their daily activities**.

Examples include:
- Mild asthma
- High blood pressure that’s under control
- Type 2 diabetes with no complications
- Smoking without signs of lung disease
- Mild obesity (BMI 30–40)

This classification helps your surgical team understand how your body might respond to anesthesia and surgery.

## Why It’s On the Consent Form

The ASA classification helps your care team:
- Choose the right anesthesia plan
- Monitor your vital signs during surgery
- Plan for recovery after the procedure

Knowing you're ASA II helps them take precautions that keep you safe.
